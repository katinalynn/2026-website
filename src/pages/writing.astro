    <h2>Unexpected Flourishing: Growth from Decay in the Mycelial University</h2>
    <p class="book-meta">punctum books | Forthcoming 2026</p>
    <div class="book-with-cover">

        <p>This work uses fungal ecology as a framework for examining possibilities within higher education. It explores how adopting different value structures focused on abundance, sustenance, and joy could transform academic communities.</p>
        <p>Key concepts include mycelium (underground fungal structures), mycorrhizal networks (multispecies nutrient-transfer webs), and mycorenewal (ecosystem regeneration processes)—applied to themes of interdependence, coalition building, and collective thriving in academia.</p>
